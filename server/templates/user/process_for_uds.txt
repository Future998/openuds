Rules to follow, for correct working:

1.- on Develompent (and on src code), use "_static_" path for static content. It will be translated correctly to "{% get_static_prefix %}" when generating DIST
2.- The html files will be modified so they include the "template" info needed. (For example, will be added the lang code, etc...)
3.- For translations, everything between <trans> & </trans> will be promoted to a translatable string. NO MULTILINE IS ALLOWED!!! :)
4.- the login form shout start as this: <form id="loginform"
    This way, we will locate it and add the "csrf" token inside it.


This is what is done when generating "dist" 
Steps:
  1.- /*.html goes to "templates/uds/modern" (name to be defined ;-)) (these are basically login.html & index.html)
  2.- templates/* goes to "static/templates" right now. Maybe they end on "templates/uds/..." also.
  3.- All js files goes to "static/js/" (with path)
  4.- Add to HTML files the headers for the templates ({% load i18n static %} and whatever is needed)
  5.- Replace all "_static_" with "{% get_static_prefix %}"
  6.- Replace all <trans>...</trans> with {% translate "..." %} (with " escaped to &quot;)
  7.- Add after "<form id="loginform"...>" this: {% csrf_token %}, so the form contains the cross site protection.
 ... (to be continued)
