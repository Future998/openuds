TODO: 
Steps:
  1.- /*.html goes to "templates/uds/modern" (name to be defined ;-)) (these are basically login.html & index.html)
  2.- templates/* goes to "static/templates" right now. Maybe they end on "templates/uds/..." also.
  3.- All js files goes to "static/js/" (with path)
  4.- Add to HTML files the headers for the templates ({% load i18n static %} and whatever is needed)
  5.- Replace all "_static_" with "{% get_static_prefix %}"
 ... (to be continued)
