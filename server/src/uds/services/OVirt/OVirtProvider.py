    This class represents the sample services provider
    
    In this class we provide:
       * The Provider functionality
       * The basic configuration parameters for the provider
       * The form fields needed by administrators to configure this provider
       
       :note: At class level, the translation must be simply marked as so
       using ugettext_noop. This is so cause we will translate the string when
       sent to the administration client.
       
    For this class to get visible at administration client as a provider type,
    we MUST register it at package __init__.
