    This class represents the sample services provider

       * The Provider functionality
       * The basic configuration parameters for the provider
       * The form fields needed by administrators to configure this provider
       
       :note: At class level, the translation must be simply marked as so
       using ugettext_noop. This is so cause we will translate the string when
       sent to the administration client.
       
    For this class to get visible at administration client as a provider type,
    we MUST register it at package __init__.

        Normally provider values are rally used at sevice level, cause we never
        instantiate nothing except a service from a provider.

        Create your test method here so the admin can push the "check" button
