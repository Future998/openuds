    An OS Manager is responsible for communication the service the different actions to take (i.e. adding a windows machine to a domain)
    The Service (i.e. virtual machine) communicates with the OSManager via a published web method, that must include the unique ID.
    In order to make easier to agents identify themselfs, the Unique ID can be a list with various Ids (i.e. the macs of the virtual machine).
